# Recommendation_System_using_LightFM
The project uses LightFM which is a combination of content and collaborative based recommendation model which enables us to predict movies to the user based on the previous user data and also based on the ratings given by them. Its a simple way of getting the top 3 recommendations for the user based on the likes and content watched as described by the data.
